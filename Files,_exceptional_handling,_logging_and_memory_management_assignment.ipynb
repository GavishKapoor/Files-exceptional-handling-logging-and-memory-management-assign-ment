        "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages? --\n",
        "Interpreted languages execute code line‐by-line at runtime, while compiled languages translate the entire program into machine code before execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is exception handling in Python? --\n",
        "It is a mechanism that allows you to manage runtime errors (exceptions) by using keywords like try, except, else, and finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling? --\n",
        "The finally block always executes after the try and except blocks, regardless of whether an exception was raised—typically used for cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is logging in Python? --\n",
        "Logging is the process of recording messages about a program’s execution (such as informational messages, warnings, and errors) to help with debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is the significance of the del method in Python? --\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed; it’s used to clean up resources before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python? --\n",
        "\n",
        "import module: Imports the whole module (you access items with module.item).\n",
        "from module import item: Imports specific attributes or functions directly, so you can use them without the module prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python? --\n",
        "You can handle multiple exceptions by either listing them as a tuple in one except block or by using separate except blocks for each exception type.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python? --\n",
        "The with statement creates a context that automatically takes care of opening and closing a file, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing? --\n",
        "Multithreading: Uses threads that share the same memory space, useful for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Runs tasks in separate processes, each with its own memory space, which is better for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program? --\n",
        "Logging helps track events, debug issues, monitor program flow, and maintain a record of errors or unusual events.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is memory management in Python? --\n",
        "Memory management is the process by which Python allocates and deallocates memory for objects automatically, largely through its garbage collection system.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python? --\n",
        "The basic steps are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Wrap code in a try block\n",
        "Catch exceptions with except blocks\n",
        "Optionally use an else block for code that runs if no exception occurs\n",
        "Use a finally block for cleanup actions regardless of what happened\n",
        "\n",
        "13.Why is memory management important in Python? --\n",
        "Good memory management prevents resource leaks and ensures that your program uses memory efficiently, which is critical for performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling? --\n",
        "The try block contains code that might raise an exception, and the except block catches and handles those exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.How does Python's garbage collection system work? --\n",
        "Python uses a reference counting mechanism along with a cyclic garbage collector to automatically reclaim memory that is no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling? --\n",
        "The else block executes code only if the try block did not raise any exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What are the common logging levels in Python? --\n",
        "Common levels include:\n",
        "\n",
        "DEBUG\n",
        "INFO\n",
        "WARNING\n",
        "ERROR\n",
        "CRITICAL\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python? --\n",
        "os.fork() creates a child process (available only on Unix-like systems) by duplicating the current process, while the multiprocessing module provides a cross-platform API to spawn new processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python? --\n",
        "Closing a file frees up system resources and ensures that any data written to the file is properly saved to disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python? --\n",
        "\n",
        "file.read(): Reads the entire file content as a single string.\n",
        "file.readline(): Reads one line from the file at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the logging module in Python used for? --\n",
        "It is used for configuring and managing log messages, which helps in monitoring and debugging applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling? --\n",
        "The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as checking file existence, removing files, and manipulating file paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python? --\n",
        "Challenges include managing memory leaks, handling fragmentation, and optimizing performance for large data sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.How do you raise an exception manually in Python? --\n",
        "You can raise an exception using the raise keyword, e.g., raise ValueError(\"An error occurred\").\n",
        "\n",
        "25.Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications? --\n",
        "Multithreading can improve performance in I/O-bound applications by allowing multiple operations to run concurrently, reducing waiting times."
